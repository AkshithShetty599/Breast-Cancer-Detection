> A user-friendly Streamlit application for breast cancer prediction. It leverages a machine learning model trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to analyze diagnostic features extracted from cell nuclei. Based on inputs like radius, texture, concavity, and fractal dimension, the model predicts whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant**.

The app includes:
- An interactive **sidebar** to input 30 medical features grouped into mean, standard error, and worst measurements.
- A dynamic **radar chart** visualizing the scaled values of the input features.
- Real-time **prediction results** with class probability scores.
- Clean UI styling with hidden Streamlit elements for a polished experience.

The goal of this project is to support medical professionals with an AI-assisted tool for **early detection** and **risk assessment** of breast cancer, using real-world diagnostic metrics.
